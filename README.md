# Firefox-CSS Noir
Firefox-CSS Noir (Noir) is a simple CSS modification for Firefox made by FlagHater.

## Notes:

Noir was made and developed in Firefox Nightly with the purpose of making the vertical tabs look nicer. However, it works and still looks good even with horizontal tabs.

New Tab theme is with [Tabliss](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/)


## Todo:
### Re-themes:

- Loading URL Bar

- Hamburger Menu

- Context Menu

- "Show Address Bar" Icon

- Change "Expand Sidebar" tab to be Firefox black/white SVG

- Hover over Vertical Tabs menu to maximise it automatically (If possible)

- Verticle Tabs scrollbar colour change



### Plans
- Disable transparent URL Bar search when not on new menu.
- Re-theme history menu

## Setup:

1. Search about:config in your URL bar
2. Search for "`toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`"
3. Enable my double-clicking the option ("Set it to `true`")
4. Download `userChrome.css` from this page's "latest release"
5. Go in `about:profiles`
6. Go into the "Root Directory" of whatever Firefox version you are using
7. Create a new folder called "`chrome`" (if it does not exist already)
8. Paste the `userChrome.css` into the new folder
9. Restart Firefox
10. Done!

## Issues/Suggestions
If an issue or a bug is found, please create an issue! I will try my best to re-write something. Please note that this is my first Firefox CSS theme, and so it may not be the most organised or efficient. Feel free to suggest any changes/modifications in either  "pull-requests", or even in "issues"! Feedback is greatly appreciated!
